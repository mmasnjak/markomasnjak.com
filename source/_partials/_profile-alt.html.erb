    <h2 class="rule">About</h2>

    <p>I&rsquo;m a Chicago native who likes to get my hands dirty and completely immerse myself into complex design problems that can&rsquo;t be Googled. I will experiment, research, revise and learn anything possible in order to solve it with a simple, clear, modern design&nbsp;solution.</p>

    <p>As a designer, I&rsquo;m passionate about typographic design, bringing the elegance of classic modern design to the digital landscape and creating experiences that touch users on a very deep emotional level. I believe that design &mdash; regardless of medium &mdash; is something to experience and increases the value of anything it&nbsp;touches.</p>

    <p>Prior to joining <a href="https://dscout.com" target="_blank">dscout</a>, I spent a few years working with many Chicago-based startups to bring their first MVPs to market. Following that experience, I led the design team at <a href="https://getbase.com" target="_blank">Base</a> during a large growth period that began with a second round funding of $6.8M through a Series B round of $15M and contributed to significant leaps in the product&rsquo;s&nbsp;capabilities.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m a proud coffee addict always looking for my next fix. Chicago isn&rsquo;t a coffee desert by an means, however, I&rsquo;ve yet to find a cappuccino that even compares to those I&rsquo;ve enjoyed in Italy &mdash; but there&rsquo;s still&nbsp;hope.</p>
