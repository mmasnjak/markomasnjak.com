    <h2 class="rule">About</h2>

    <p>As a Chicago native, I’m a “get your hands dirty” kind of guy who completely immerses himself into complex design problems that can’t just be Googled. I will experiment, research, review and learn anything possible in order to solve it with a simple, clear, modern design solution.</p>

    <p>As a designer, I’m passionate about typographic design, bringing the elegance of classic modern design to the digital landscape and creating experiences that touch users on a very deep emotional level. I believe that design — regardless of medium — is something to experience and increases the value of anything it touches.</p>

    <p>I’m a proud coffee addict always looking for my next fix. Chicago isn’t a coffee desert by an means, however, I’ve yet to find a cappuccino that even compares to those I’ve enjoyed in Rome, Italy — but there’s still hope.</p>
